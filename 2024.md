- **FNN:** weights -> strength of the connections between neurons. 

- weights are learned during the training process using backpropagation.

- sigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent function, rectified linear unit (ReLU) function

- **Linear Layer:** in a neural network is a fundamental building block that performs a linear transformation on its input. 

- It is commonly used in fully connected (dense) layers and is defined mathematically as: y = W x + b

- Compute Gradients (Backpropagation)

- Loss function quantifies the error between predicted and actual values.

- Update the weights using an optimization algorithm.
